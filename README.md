# Data and code information

## AKITA_LCM_RNASeq_Treatment
This study includes 54 mouse kidney samples stratified into 9 groups based on disease, treatment, and genotype explanatory variables. The table below summarizes the experimental design.
&nbsp;

| **Disease** | **Treatment** | **Genotype** | **Samples** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Non-Diabetic | Vehicle | WT | 6 |
| Non-Diabetic | Dapagliflozin | WT | 6 |
| Non-Diabetic | Vehicle | KO | 6 |
| Non-Diabetic | Dapagliflozin | KO | 6 |
| Diabetic | Vehicle | WT | 6 |
| Diabetic | Dapagliflozin | WT | 6 |
| Diabetic | Semaglutide | WT | 6 |
| Diabetic | Vehicle | KO | 6 |
| Diabetic | Dapagliflozin | KO | 6 |

## Data

The raw sequencing data is available from the volume directory: ``Bioinformatics_dk/RNAseq/VVDA_mouse_CKD_AKITA_treatment``

## Results

The table below lists all of the results files

&nbsp;

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| Data/ | Input FASTQ files |
| Genome/ | Reference genome files |
| workspace_EDA/ | Exploratory data analysis and results |
| workspace_RING/ | RING Rdata object files for differential analysis using DESeq2 |
| Manifest.csv | Manifest file |

*Note: The differential expression analysis was first performed with all samples included in the DESeq model. After inspecting the exploratory data analysis plots, it was clear some groups had much higher within-group variation than others. This would affect the performance of the DESeq model, so subsequent comparisons were made using only the samples within the respective groups which were being compared. See the [FAQ section](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#if-i-have-multiple-groups-should-i-run-all-together-or-split-into-pairs-of-groups) of the DESeq2 manual for more information.*
